# Docsy public distribution status

> **Directory PR recovery (27 October 2026):** Deleted source forks from the 26 October cleanup have been recreated. [36 recovered PRs and the original-to-new mapping](#directory-pr-recovery-27-october-2026) are verified open and awaiting upstream review. Previous merged listings remain unchanged.

Checked **25 October 2026**. A submitted directory listing is **not** an approved marketplace installation.

## Connect directly

- Website: https://docsy.remcp.site
- **Canonical OAuth 2.1 MCP endpoint:** `https://docsy.remcp.site/mcp/registry`
- [Plugin releases](https://github.com/getremcp/docsy-plugin/releases)
- [SDK & CLI repository](https://github.com/getremcp/docsy)
- [Getting started](GETTING-STARTED.md) · [AI client integrations](CLIENT-INTEGRATIONS.md)

The canonical MCP endpoint returns **HTTP 401** without OAuth; /readyz returned **HTTP 200** on 25 Oct 2026. Official Registry and release checks confirmed active Docsy v1.0.9 matching the stable plugin-v1.0.9 GitHub release. The previously active io.github.antonbaider/docsy v1.0.5 entry was deprecated with the authenticated publisher CLI. It advertised the obsolete /mcp path rather than the canonical /mcp/registry endpoint.

**Closed review:** [AlexMili Awesome MCP #326](https://github.com/AlexMili/Awesome-MCP/pull/326) closed 24 Oct 2026: the directory requires MCP server source; `docsy-plugin` contains host integration metadata and is not the hosted server implementation. Do not resubmit this plugin as a server source without changing eligibility.

## Other submitted channels (not independently approved)

[TrackMCP](https://trackmcp.com/submit-mcp) returned "This tool has already been submitted" on 25 October 2026 for the canonical Docsy public repository; no fresh submission and no public listing verified.

[ClaudeMods editorial submission #34](https://github.com/omarcevi/claudemods/issues/34) was filed on 25 October 2026 for Docsy; its review/bot-generated catalog PR is not yet confirmed.

MCPRepository accepted Docsy for indexing on 24 Oct and completed publication by 25 Oct. The [public Docsy listing](https://mcprepository.com/getremcp/docsy-plugin) was verified with HTTP 200, the exact title and the linked `getremcp/docsy-plugin` repository. Listed above as published.

Also confirmed: [MCP.Directory](https://mcp.directory/submit) returned HTTP 409 for the Docsy GitHub URL on 24 October 2026, reporting that the repository had already been submitted and is awaiting review. No duplicate submission was made.

Previously submitted on 24 October 2026: [CheckMCP](https://checkmcp.dev/submit), [ProMCP](https://www.promcpservers.com/submit), [MCPfinder](https://www.mcpfinder.org/submit), [AIBase](https://aibase.com/user/submitManage?tab=mcp), [ClaudePluginHub](https://www.claudepluginhub.com/tools/submit-plugin), [MCP Index](https://themcpindex.com/submit), [MCP Market](https://mcpmarket.com/submit), [MCP Servers](https://mcpservers.org/submit), and [GitHub VS Code/Copilot onboarding](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/discussions/1257#discussioncomment-19165953).

[MCPizy](https://mcpizy.com/submit/thanks?ref=web_mvnk6me0_a8jruk&tier=standard) acknowledged Docsy submission on 25 Oct 2026 (ID `web_mvnk6me0_a8jruk`) in its free review queue; it is not yet verified publicly.

[Plug and Ship](https://plugandship.dev/p/docsy-mcp) has an accessible public listing page. Its free daily-board launch is scheduled for **12 November 2026** according to the submission confirmation. The [mcpservers.org listing URL](https://mcpservers.org/servers/getremcp/docsy-plugin) appeared in search results, but direct automated verification returned **403** on 24 October 2026, so it is not marked independently verified.

[FindMCP](https://findmcp.app/submit) accepted the Docsy MCP submission via API on 25 Oct 2026, returning `{ "success": true, "message": "Submission received for review", "data": { "id": 320, "slug": "docsy" } }`. This is a review-queue acknowledgment, not confirmation of public publication.

[Few Servers](https://www.fewservers.com/mcp/submit/) returned an email handoff (the form does not store submissions). A separate listing/claim request for Docsy was sent to the address given by the site on 25 October 2026, and Gmail returned a sent-message ID. External review and any claim verification are outstanding; **do not mark this published**.

[AgenticSkills](https://agenticskills.io/submit?type=mcp) confirmed `MCP Server Submitted!` for Docsy on 25 October 2026. Free submission is in a weekly review queue; no public entry has yet been verified.

[MCP Harbor](https://mcpharbor.app/submit/) confirmed receipt of a free Docsy GitHub submission on 24 October 2026 and returned the submission acknowledgment again on 25 October 2026. The review and daily indexing are still pending; this is not yet a verified public listing.

The publisher confirmation page directly displayed the free-queue date **12 November 2026** for Docsy on 24 October 2026. The earlier 11 November date was superseded. The [public Docsy page](https://plugandship.dev/p/docsy-mcp) is already accessible independently of the daily-board launch.

## Smithery sunset — 31 October 2026

[Smithery's official notice](https://smithery.ai/future) confirms that API, hosted proxies at `server.smithery.ai` and `run.tools`, Connect, Toolbox, accounts and keys, CLI and SDKs stop on **31 October 2026**. Smithery remains a curated, non-proxied directory under Arcade.dev.

Docsy's earlier update returned `403 Updating servers has been removed`: this is a retired publishing API, **not** a broken Docsy MCP. No new Smithery listing is claimed. Do not offer Smithery CLI/proxy installation. Keep Docsy OAuth 2.1 and Cloudflare protections.

**Statuses:** Published means verified public listing; submitted means awaiting review; scheduled means future release. Never equate listings with official OpenAI, Anthropic or Cursor marketplace approval.

## Directory PR recovery (27 October 2026)

This is a record of the accidental source-fork deletion on **26 October 2026** and the replacement GitHub pull requests. The original contribution commits are preserved in recreated fork histories; some head branches were updated to current upstream and current OAuth metadata. Original PR discussions remain accessible. All replacement PRs are **pending maintainer review**, not approved listings.

## Intentional exclusions

- The original [AlexMili/Awesome-MCP #326](https://github.com/AlexMili/Awesome-MCP/pull/326) was **closed 24 October** by its maintainer because plugin manifests alone are not the hosted MCP server source. It was not resubmitted.
- The referenced ccplugins/awesome-claude-code-plugins PR #821 is inaccessible; the repository has pull requests disabled (GitHub 410), so a replacement PR cannot be submitted there.
- Already merged PRs in AIAnytime, TensorBlock, Sagargupta16, VoltAgent, ToolSDK, and punkpeye/awesome-remote-mcp-servers remain unchanged.

- The earlier [Cline #244](https://github.com/cline/marketplace/pull/244) was automatically closed after fork deletion; the currently open [Cline #346](https://github.com/cline/marketplace/pull/346) is the replacement contribution, avoiding duplicate PRs.

## Recovery method

Source fork names changed where needed to avoid collisions, but commit objects, original changes, and target branches were restored via GitHub API and compared to upstream. Original closed PRs cannot be reopened because GitHub rejects the operation after deletion of the original source repository (HTTP 422).
